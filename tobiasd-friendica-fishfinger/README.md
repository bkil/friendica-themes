Fishfinger Theme
================

This theme is my currently used theme, which is derived from quattro, so you
need that theme to get Fishfinger working (but that wont be hard as quattro is
one of the default themes.). It works for me with the browser I use and is not
intended for anybody else to use ;-) If you still want to use it, ypu are free
to do so, but please don't start making suggestions (or at least don't expect
them to be heard).

One of these things is the main menu at the right panel which is filled with
the important links for me. A second is the width of the theme which is
optimized for 1024px screen, which happen to be the resolution that I have
available on my screens.

Used Fonts
==========

This theme uses fonts from the internet that are free to use, but their
creators should be honored.

__As the theme uses webfonts it is not recommended for connections with limited
bandwidth__.
